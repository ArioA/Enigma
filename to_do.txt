- 'functionalise' as much of constructors in plugboard.pb,
reflector.rf and rotor.cpp. Have a look at the one in
configuration.cpp as well.
- Modify all functions containing exit() so that they pass by
reference a int errno parameter and return to the main with errno as
the error number if an error is encountered.
